This is our solution to Microsoft's OpenHack challanges

## Minecraft Server Manager Webapp
We developed an app that manages to create, list and delete minecraft servers
into our Kubernetes cluster automatically.

We deployed a simple front-end at [minecraft-server-manager.azurewebsites.net](https://minecraft-server-manager.azurewebsites.net) and there is available the [Open API specication](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/LeoCBS/openhack/1.0.0) too.
